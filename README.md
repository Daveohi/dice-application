Kodecamp Promotional task 6

## Getting Started

The app initializes with Dice (1).
Tapping the "Roll Dice" button rolls the dice and displays a random number with the corresponding image.
Even numbers trigger a toast message.
Odd numbers trigger a toast message.
Rolling a 6 triggers a specific toast message.
After 6 rolls, it displays the total sum of random numbers generated.
Tapping the "Reset" button resets the game
